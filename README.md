# LearnOpenGL
Me learning OpenGL :)

This project is not going to be very interesting and will probably not be useful for anyone but myself

### Libraries:
Place compiled library files (.lib) into src/libs. You will have to provide your own compiled libraries for your own OS and CPU architecture.

Alternatively, you can edit LIBS_PATH variable in the CMake cache to change the location if you wish.

If the library file has a different name (ex. glfw3.lib -> glfw.lib), then you can edit the cache variable for that library. ex. GLFW_LIBRARY=glfw.lib

#### External Libraries Needed:

- GLFW
